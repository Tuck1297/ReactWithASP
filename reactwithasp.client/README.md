# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


# Notes

Still need pages for the following account api routes

2. Need to restrict account access on specific pages...
3. create global context that will store and manage logged in state (refresh bearer token will be stored in localstorage)
4. design a simple homepage that like v0 with their AI
5. Connect account endpoints

6. If I have time come back to do 2 factor authentication
